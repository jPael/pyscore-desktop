   # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
   assets:
      - assets\icons\operator.png
      - assets\icons\python.png
      - assets\icons\search.png
      - assets\images\loginDesign.jpg
      - assets\images\binary.jpg
      - assets\icons\password.png
      - assets\icons\user.jpeg
      - assets\gif\try.gif
      - assets\gif\try1.gif
      - assets\gif\try2.gif

   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
   # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

   # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
   # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

   # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
   # example:
   # fonts:
   #   - family: Schyler
   #     fonts:
   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
   #         style: italic
   #   - family: Trajan Pro
   #     fonts:
   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
   #         weight: 700
